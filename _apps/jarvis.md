JARVIS is an AI Personal Assistant I am building to handle common tasks in my daily workflow. It is intended to replace the large number of apps required in modern-day workflows, and instead serve as a centralised hubs for common tasks such as controlling smart home appliances, querying the weather, writing notes, etc.
<br><br>
The name 'JARVIS' is inspired by Iron Man's AI Assistant. I thought the natural language processing that JARVIS possessed in the movies/comics is really cool, and that is something I am building into my version of JARVIS thanks to OpenAI's ChatGPT. 
<br><br>
Currently JARVIS operates via a simple Flutter Application that can send a query to my API, and return the raw response. In the future this will be tidied up and expanded functionality-wise, and eventually updated to support other visual flows (for example as a dashboard or integrated into a smartwatch application).
<br><br>
This project is still a work in progress, and this description will update as more functionality is added. Please check the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Rahulio2D/JARVIS) for more info.
