        <p>Running Against Time is a game I made myself using the Unity Engine in a small timeframe of three days. As the game was made independently I was responsible for all aspects of the game, including programming, game design, quality assurance and UI design (however, the art was obtained from <a href="https://rvros.itch.io/animated-pixel-hero">here</a>).
        <br><br>
        The game revolves around the theme of time and incremental difficulty. In Running Against Time you have an eight-second timer which is constantly counting down, and you must collect gems in order to refill this timer. Each level is also connected together which further emphasises the need to rush to collect gems, as taking too much time in one level may cause you to run out of time in the next. Additionally, as the game contains an incremental difficulty curve the player is further challenged by the level design alongside the time constraint, which causes the player to often make mistakes but also quickly overcome them.

        Running Against Time can be downloaded from <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uNDgNhBaeFnRJSsTeDax8lq1KZin6p4I" target="#blank">here</a>, and it is playable on Windows and MacOS.
