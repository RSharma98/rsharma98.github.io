        <h1>Traffic Rush</h1>
        <p>Traffic Rush is a simple 3D game I built as part of the Advanced Games Technology module on my university course. The game was made with C++ and OpenGL, and although this game is far from my best work I'm fairly pleased with the result considering C++ is not my strongest language.
        <br><br>
        The game consists of a player controlling a car along an endlessly generated road, where they must move left/right to avoid oncoming traffic and other obstacles in the road (such as rocks). Additionally, the player can collect a few power-ups (boost and shield) in the game to provide them with a temporary advantage.
