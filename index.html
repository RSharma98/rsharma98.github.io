            <p>Here are some of the games I've worked on in the past (or am currently working on) that I am most proud of.</p>

            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <p>In my free time I've been using the Unity Engine and C#, working on all types of games from a simple Pong game to a more complex procedurally generated 2D Platformer. Over the years I've built up my skillset in Unity and learnt not only how the game engine works, but also some best practices when it comes to developing games with the engine and outside it.
            <br><br>
            At university I have been taught how to use a few programming languages, namely C++ and Java. Along with learning the fundamentals of howto write code in these languages, I also learnt about how the code is interpreted by computers and the importance of data structures and algorithms, helping me learn how to write more efficient and readable code.
            <br><br>
            Another key skill I believe I possess is determination. When working on something I remain committed to it, by putting in the work where needed and learning new skills that are required to complete the task. This helps me to not only complete the task, but also ensure the completed task is in the best state it can be.
