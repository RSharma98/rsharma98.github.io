            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Rahul Sharma and I'm a twenty year old student and entrepreneur based in London, United Kingdom.
                Currently studying Computer Science with Games Technology at City, University of London, I have a good knowledge of
                a few programming languages such as C# and Java, and am learning more languages such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, 
                C++ and Python in order to widen my skillset.
                <br> <br>
                In 2015 I started my own games development company called <a href="http://www.forgottenpixel.com", target="_blank">Forgotten Pixel</a> 
                to learn more about the games development process by developing commercial games. I am currently working on a 2D Platformer called 
                <a href="http://www.forgottenpixel.weebly.com/demon-debug.html", target="_blank">Demon Debug</a> with a team of individuals who specialise 
                in other areas of game development (such as art and audio design). My responsibilities on the team involve not only programming, but also game design, 
                team/project management and business management.
