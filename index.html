            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <p>In my free time I've been using the Unity Engine and C#, working on all types of games from a simple Pong game to a more complex procedurally generated 2D Platformer. Over the years I've built up my skillset in Unity and learnt not only how the game engine works, but also some best practices when it comes to developing games with the engine and outside it.
            <br><br>
            At university I have been taught how to use a few programming languages, namely C++ and Java. Along with learning the fundamentals of howto write code in these languages, I also learnt about how code is interpreted by computers and the importance of data structures andalgorithms, helping me learn how to write more efficient and readable code.
            <br><br>
            Another skill I believe I possess is determination. When working on something I am committed to giving it my all and seeing it through,even learning new stuff where required.
