        <h1>Don't Touch The Spikes</h1>
        <p>Don't Touch The Spikes is a simple game I made as part of a coding bootcamp at the beginning of my university course. It is one of the first games I ever made and it was made using <a href="https://processing.org" target="_blank">Processing</a> in just a few days.
        <br><br>
        The game involves the player controlling a simple character that automatically moves left/right and flips directions after hitting a wall. Each wall, however, contains a number of spikes that are randomly positioned each time and the player must make the character jump to avoid these spikes.
        <br><br>
        The project's source code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/RSharma98/Avoid-The-Spikes">Github</a>, where the code can be downloaded and run through the processing editor.
