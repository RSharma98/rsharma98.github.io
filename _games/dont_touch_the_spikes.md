Don't Touch The Spikes is a simple game I made as part of a coding bootcamp at the beginning of my university course. It is one of the first games I ever made and it was made using Processing in just a few days.
<br><br>
The game involves the player controlling a simple character that automatically moves left/right and flips directions after hitting a wall. Each wall, however, contains a number of spikes that are randomly positioned each time and the player must make the character jump to avoid these spikes.
<br><br>
The project's source code is available on my Github, where the code can be downloaded and run through the processing editor.
