This is a game that I developed using C++ and SDL to improve my skills and knowledge of programming a game without using an engine. Since it was my first independent project in C++ I kept it simple but wanted to make a game with an enjoyable core loop. The finished game is a top-down puzzler in which you navigate the character from the starting point towards the treasure while avoiding the hidden obstacles. To avoid code repetion I implemented some simple systems into the game, such as a tilemap system, a rendering system, and a basic game object structure. A full view of everything that I have worked on for this game is available on the project's <a href="https://trello.com/b/ile3gULZ/sdl-dungeon-game" target="#blank">Trello board</a>.
