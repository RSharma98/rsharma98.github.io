This is a game I am actively developing using C++ and SDL in order to improve my skills in those aspects. The goal of the project is to develop a simple 2D puzzle game with a few levels to better understand how to make a game without an engine and to demonstrate my C++ skills on my portfolio. 
<br><br>
As this is a learning project I am aiming to keep the scope of the project low to complete it soon and to a high standard. For this game I have developed a simple rendering system, tilemap system, and implemented basic game objects that objects can inherit certain variables from to avoid code repetition. A full view of everything that I have worked on for this game and what I am working towards is available on the projects <a href="https://trello.com/b/ile3gULZ/sdl-dungeon-game" target="#blank">Trello board</a>.
