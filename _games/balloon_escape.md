Balloon Escape is a simple mobile game I made as a joke based on the IT movies. In the game you control Pennywise's balloon and have to dodge endlessly generated platforms to build up a highscore. The game was designed with mobile in mind and the most complex part of development was getting the game running on Android as it involved installing the Android Studio SDK, debugging errors related to Android deployment, and implementing touchscreen controls - all of which were completely new to me.
