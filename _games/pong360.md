Pong360 is a simple game I built in a short time using the Unity Engine, the initial game was built in under a day, however, some edits were made later to make the game slightly more fun and get it working as a WebGL build. The concept of the game involves rotating a paddle around the centre to try and hit the ball continuously to build up a high-score. The game is playable below (only on desktops) and the source code is available on my Github.
