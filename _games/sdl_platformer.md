This is a game I am actively developing using C++ and SDL in order to improve my skills in those aspects. The goal of the project is to develop a simple 2D platformer with a few levels to better understand how to make a game without an engine and to demonstrate my C++ skills on my portfolio.

As this is a learning project I am aiming to keep the scope of the project low to complete it soon and to a high standard. For this game I have developed a simple rendering system, tilemap system, and implemented basic game objects that objects can inherit certain variables from to avoid code repetition. Although not implemented yet, I am also planning to implement other stuff into this game soon, such as a collision system and some simple enemy AI.
