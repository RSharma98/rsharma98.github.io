Demon Debug is a 2D Platformer I've been making using the Unity Engine and in collaboration with other professionals in the industry. On the game, my work has primarily involved programming, game design and team management. The game is not currently available, but an Alpha build will be released very soon!
<br><br>
The story of Demon Debug revolves around 'The Programmer', who has created a software which could change the world and improve the lives of millions. Satan cannot tolerate this and decides to kidnap your programming team and steal your software just as it's about to launch. It's now up to you to step into Hell, save your team, recover your software, and show Satan whoâ€™s boss!
