SDL Shooter (name not final) is a top-down shooter game I'm developing myself as a way to learn more about C++ and the SDL library by creating a game with more advanced elements. The goal of developing this game is not just to create a game for my portfolio, but rather to create a mini-framework which can make the process of creating future 2D games much easier.
<br><br>
This game is still a work-in-progress which is slowly nearing completion, with most of the systems being in place now and the final steps being to work on the gameplay loop. Many of the systems in this game have been designed to be flexible and allow easy adaptation for future 2D projects, including a Level Editor and Level Serializer (which can parse and export to XML formats), Texture Management, Render Management, Physics/Collision Systems, Input Systems, and more. In the near future I hope to add basic UI and audio systems to help bring this game closer to completion.

Below you can see a GIF of the Level Editor in action as well as some work-in-progress gameplay and art (these images will continue to be updated as the game develops). You can also [download the source code]({{ page.source_code }}) and run the game locally.
