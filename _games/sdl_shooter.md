SDL Shooter (name not final) is a top-down shooter game I'm developing myself as a way to learn more about C++ and the SDL library by creating a game with more advanced elements. The goal of developing this game is not just to create a game for my portfolio, but rather to create a mini-framework which can make the process of creating future 2D games much easier.

This game is far from being marked as complete, but many systems have been designed to simplify the creation of this game and future games too. Some of these systems include an advanced texture renderer, an animation system, particle system, orthographic camera system, physics/collision system, input system, game object manager, texture manager, and more. In the near future I hope to add a basic level serialization system, audio, and some basic UI to create something representative of an actual game.
