Traffic Rush is a simple 3D game I built using C++ and OpenGL as part of my Advanced Games Technology module on my university course. The game requires the player to control a car along an endlessly generated road by moving left/right to avoid oncoming traffic and other obstacles in the road. The game also features power-ups (such as a speed boost and shield) to provide temporary gameplay advantages to the player.

The game consists of various elements such as meshes, textures, collision detection, different camera views, a functional main menu and control system. It is far from my best work but considering it is my first game built using C++ I am very proud of the work done on this game and the final outcome!
